#Robotics Software Engineering Group Project
######Computer Science - King's College London

We programmed a robot with 16 sonar sensors and a fiducial sensor to map its environment and gather objects. We used the [Player](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/) robot device interface and the 
[Stage](http://playerstage.sourceforge.net/) multiple robot simulator. 

###Video
Here is a [video](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xfeQyYjLcSQ) of our robot scanning a large map and collecting all objects.

###Technical Achievements

* SLAM (Simultaneous Localisation And Mapping)
* The path finding methods have to be efficient and fast (Dijkstra's algorithm and the A* search algorithm)
* Map is scalable in all directions
* Perfect in sync Player/Stage data
* Resolveing collisions
* Map 100% convered by sonar & fiducial sensors
